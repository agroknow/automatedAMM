      <dcterms:abstract xml:lang="en">Milk testing and quality control should be carried out at all stages of the dairy chain. Milk can be tested for quantity, organoleptic characteristic, compositional characteristic, physical and chemical characteristics, hygienic  characteristics, adulteration or drug residues.The content of the major constituents of raw milk is important for milk payment system.Enzymes naturally present in the milk can change the chemical composition of rawmilk. Also, enzymes secreted by bacteria or enzymes from somatic cells can degrade the raw milk composition. Products of these degradation reactions can have undesirable effects on milk structure, smell and taste. It is very important that farm-fresh raw milk be cooled immediately to not more than 8 °C in the case of daily collection, ornot more than 6 °C if collection is not daily.During  transport the cold chain must be maintained. An authorized person, properly trained in the appropriate  technique, shall perform sampling of bulk milk in farm. Laboratory samples should be dispatched  immediately after sampling  to thedairy company and consequently to the testing  laboratory. The time for dispatch of the samples to the testing laboratory should  be as short as possible, preferably within 24 h. Laboratory samples shall be transported and stored at temperature  1  to 5 °C. Higher  temperatures  may adversely affect the composition of the laboratory sample and may cause  disputes between the farmer, the dairy company and the laboratory. The effect  of refrigerated storage at temperature  4 °C during 24 h on the composition of raw milk were investigated in this work, because we wanted to know how the milk composition will be changed and how the laboratory results will be affected. In many cases, the samples are not  preserved with chemical  preservants like  azidiol, bronopol, potassium dichromate or Microtabs.We found, that the composition of raw cows’ milk after 24 was changed  significantly (p&gt;0.005). We found an average decrease in the fat content of -0.04g/100g, increase  in  the  protein content of +0.02 g/100g, increase in  the  lactose content of +0.02g/100g, increase in the solid-not-fat content of +0.02g/100g and decrease in the total solid content of -0.02 g/100g. It is necessary to cool the raw cows’ milk after  the  milking  to decrease the changes in milk composition caused mainly due  to the lipolytic activity of lipase</dcterms:abstract>
