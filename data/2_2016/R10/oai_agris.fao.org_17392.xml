      <dcterms:abstract xml:lang=" ">The paper presents the issues of natural regeneration under the canopy of the small-leaved forests in the North of the European part of Russia. The study was conducted in the bilberry birch and aspen forests of different age. The natural spruce regeneration in the North under the canopy of small-leaved forests runs in a prosperous groove. Something like 4.4 thousand ind./ha of undergrowth are under the canopy of the birch forests. Among the total number there are more than 3 thousand ind./ha of spruce undergrowth that is enough to restore the spruce forests due to the silvicultural requirements and technologies in the logging opera-tions. The spruce undergrowth in the aspen forests is mostly located in the mid-taiga sub-zone (an average of 2.8 thousand ind./ha), which is also sufficient for their reformation in the hardwood spruce and spruce plantations. Spruce reforestation in the aspen forests in the Northern taiga subzone is unsatisfactory. No more than 1 thousand ind./ha of young spruce and about 0.6 ind./ha of birch are observed here. The state of the spruce undergrowth under the canopy of the birch and aspen forests is unsatisfactory, but it can be improved by selec-tive and gradual felling. The total number of spruce undergrowth and especially the share of large undergrowth under the canopy of small-leaved forests decrease from north to south, and the share of small young growth increases. The birch forests of the northern subzone differ from the middle subzone by high content of undergrowth under the canopy. The aver-age age and height of the spruce undergrowth in the bilberry birch forests of the northern subzone compared to the middle subzone is 10 years elder</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract xml:lang="">they are 48 and 38 years, and 2.5 and 1.4 m, respectively. The share of broadleaved species in the reforestation process of the birch and aspen forests ranges from 10 to 28 %. The main representative in the undergrowth is birch (82 %). The share of aspen in the young growth in the birch forests does not exceed 6 %, in the aspen forests it rises up to 17 %.</dcterms:abstract>
